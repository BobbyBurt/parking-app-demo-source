This repository contains the source code for the Spottr app demo. [Try the demo in-browser on any device here.](https://bobbyburt.itch.io/spottr-parking-info-app-demo)

Most of the app's manually written code is found in [/src/scenes/Map.js starting at line 1027](https://github.com/BobbyBurt/parking-app-demo-source/blob/83c61bb06140c6cfbf879a3e0478d3c13146e91a/src/scenes/Map.js#L1027)

This demo was made in Javascript using the Phaser 3 game framework library. The Phaser Editor application was used to organize the project and arrange the UI, generating the code for object initialization.
